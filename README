NAME
    MooseX::Types::Path::Class::MoreCoercions - More powerful coercion than
    MooseX::Types::Path::Class

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
      ### specification of type constraint with coercion

      package Foo;

      use Moose;
      use MooseX::Types::Path::Class::MoreCoercions qw/File AbsDir/;

      has filename => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => File,
        coerce => 1,
      );

      has directory => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => AbsDir,
        coerce => 1,
      );

      ### usage in code

      my $tmp = File::Temp->new;

      Foo->new( filename => $tmp ); # coerced to Path::Class::File
      Foo->new( directory => '.' ); # coerced to dir('.')->absolute

DESCRIPTION
    This module extends MooseX::Types::Path::Class with more powerful
    coercions, including:

    *   coercing objects with overloaded stringification

    *   coercing to absolute paths

SUBTYPES
    This module uses MooseX::Types to define the following subtypes.

  Dir
    "Dir" is a subtype of "MooseX::Types::Path::Class::Dir". Objects with
    overloaded stringification are coerced as strings if coercion is
    enabled.

  AbsDir
    "AbsDir" is a subtype of "Dir" (above). Objects are also coerced to an
    absolute path.

  File
    "File" is a subtype of "MooseX::Types::Path::Class::File". Objects with
    overloaded stringification are coerced as strings if coercion is
    enabled.

  AbsFile
    "AbsFile" is a subtype of "File" (above). Objects are also coerced to an
    absolute path.

CAVEATS
  Usage with File::Temp
    Because an argument is stringified and then coerced into a Path::Class
    object, no reference to the original File::Temp argument is held. Be
    sure to hold an external reference to it to avoid immediate cleanup of
    the object at the end of the enclosing scope.
